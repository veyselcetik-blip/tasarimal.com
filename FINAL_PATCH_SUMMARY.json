    "Automated: ensured includes/bootstrap.php is included in PHP files, created payment & notification stubs, injected winner snippet into view/project files when possible.",
    "Automated: added a top-of-file warning comment for files containing mysql_query/mysqli_query recommending prepared statements.",
    "Remaining manual work: replace raw SQL concatenations with prepared statements (automated edits not safe enough), adapt winner query to actual DB schema, integrate secure_upload() into upload flows, test subscription checkout with real provider, comprehensively review role/permission checks.",
    "Files modified are in the patched zip. Run manual tests in a development environment before deploying to production."
