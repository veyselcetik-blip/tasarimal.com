    "Automated changes made. Some replacements of md5/sha1 were done to call safe_hash().",
    "safe_verify() in includes/security.php will accept legacy md5/sha1 hashes for login verification; recommend migrating users to password_hash by rehashing on successful login.",
    "Files that used $_FILES but did not have move_uploaded_file were updated to include security.php to give developers access to secure_upload(). You must update the upload flow to use secure_upload() and handle returned path/DB storage.",
    "Header files (if found) had CSS/JS includes added so the new stylesheet and UI helpers load.",
    "This is a best-effort automated pass. Manual review is still required for logic-specific secure fixes (e.g., replacing inline SQL with prepared statements).",
    "Next steps recommended in order: 1) Replace all raw SQL concatenation with prepared statements. 2) Use safe_verify() for authentication and rehash to password_hash where applicable. 3) Replace upload flows to call secure_upload() and validate usage. 4) Implement displaying competition winners in the project view by querying DB for winner and showing winner badge and winner presentation at top of submissions."
